I do not yet have much stuff here, but be sure to check out these cool places:

## Tcl/Tk
- [Tcl/Tk](https://www.tcl-lang.org) and its [mirror](https://github.com/tcltk/tcl) here in GitHub
- A lot of packages for Tcl can be found on the page of the ["Github Tcl organization"](https://github.com/tcltk)
- [fossil SCM](https://fossil-scm.org) and its [mirror](https://github.com/drhsqlite/fossil-mirror) here on GitHub

## Markdown
- [CommonMark](https://github.com/commonmark) is the place to start when you want to work with any markdown project
- [SubEthaEdit](https://github.com/subethaedit) is a nice and light-weight macOS editor also supporting markdown including a preview feature that is highly customizable. It uses the [showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) parser written in Javascript
